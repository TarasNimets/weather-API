In the program, I used two open APIs: https://api.apixu.com – for the searcher of weather, https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode – for the searcher of city. You can enter in the search any name of city on the any language.
On the screenshots you will see program in the work.

apixu.com resource changed the response content, so one of the three program modules doesn't work!
